Questions inspired from 100dev's very own, 20jasper's [interview-question-api]

### Development

This App uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) Node Package Manager to manage it's dependencies and packages.

from the root directory run

```
npm install
```

~~Create a .env file in the server folder and add your values.~~

~~For example:~~

```
 Right now we aren't using any secrets, but we will list references here when the time comes.
```

To Start the app in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

### Database

Currently using dockerized [mongodb](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)

**[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) will need to be installed to run the database**

To bring database up

```
npm run db:up
```

To stop the database

```
npm run db:stop
```
